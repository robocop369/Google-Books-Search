# Google Books Search

### Overview

In this app, you will utilize a new React-based Google Books Search. This assignment allows you to use React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on your searches. Another great added feature built within the app is that you can save books to review or purchase later.

      description: "Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature."
